        <h1>TONY STARK A.K.A IRONMAN</h1>
        <p>A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a
            severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass
            destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later,
            Stark
            develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark
            Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first
            concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.</p>
